            Hey there! I'm a soon-to-be IT engineering graduate from Bhutan,
            navigating my way through the world of full-stack development.
            Coding is my thingâ€”I love the thrill of solving problems, breaking
            things (on purpose), and then fixing them again (hopefully).

            When I'm not busy building software, you can probably find me
            shooting hoops, binge-watching anime, or diving into a good book (or
            at least trying to build that habit). My goal? To become a software
            engineer and craft solutions that make a real impact. Until then,
            I'll be here, coding away and occasionally questioning my life
            choices when a bug refuses to go away.
